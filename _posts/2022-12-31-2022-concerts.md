title: "2022 Concerts"
---

After the pandemic put the kibosh on live music awhile, I saw some cracking concerts this past year.

## Jack White

Boy can this fellow handle a guitar. Without Meg I feared we might only hear his solo stuff (which rips, don't get me wrong), but he played All The Hits From *Elephant* and then some. It's not the magic of The White Stripes duo, but it's close.

When we entered the stadium we had to put our phones in a locked pouch, ostensibly so that we'd focus on enjoying the show rather than documenting it. Other then losing a pretence to avoid conversation with the strangers next to me, I didn't mind; my photos would have been lousy anyway.

## Elton John

Seeing aging rockstars is a gamble --- will it be a joyous celebration of musical achievements, or a cruel meditation on declining health? --- but Elton still delivers the goods. What a voice. All The Hits From *Goodbye Yellow Brick Road* and then some.

## Gorillaz

I half-expected 100% cartoon monkeys with Damon Albarn performing in the dark or something, but thankfully there were no such gimmicks. The audience was diverse: teens, boomers, gen whatever, all ages had a ball. All The Hits From *Demon Days* and then some.

Before the encore the screens flashed an image of Queen Elizabeth II. This was a few days after her death, and the audience reaction was... mixed. Some scattered cheers, some hesitant claps, some booing and shouts of "fuck the monarchy." It was a strange moment.

## Metric

The Orpheum is this beautiful concert hall where the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra performs. The acoustics are unbeatable. It was the perfect setting for Metric's atmospheric synth-pop-rock. They're in the sweet spot where they're too popular for small clubs but not popular enough to fill a stadium, so they play medium-sized venues like The Orpheum where they sound terrific.

I last saw Metric 16 years ago at an outdoor concert during frosh week. I got sunburned and the acoustics were abysmal. This show was much better.

## Bret McKenzie

This show was *fun*. He only played one song from Flight of the Conchords, but his new non-comedy music is groovy stuff. He did a bit where he wrote a song live using a story provided by an audience member, and the result --- a ballad about two long distance lovers finally meeting in person in Bauline, Newfoundland --- was catchier than most tunes on the radio. That talented bastard.

## 2023

The coming year is going to be another doozy for live music, I can *feel* it. "All bangers, all the time."
