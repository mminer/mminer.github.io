title: "Unity Position Visualizer"
---

In my day job I often need to visualize positions in Unity. Given a coordinate, I might drop a cube in the scene to serve as a visual marker, but it's a clunky workflow. Here's [an editor tool](https://github.com/mminer/position-visualizer) I built to make this easier. I find it useful; maybe you will too.
