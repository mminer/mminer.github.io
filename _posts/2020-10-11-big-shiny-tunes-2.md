title: "<em>Big Shiny Tunes 2</em>"

The first album I bought was *Big Shiny Tunes 2*.[^1] Compilation albums are anachronistic today, but in the 90s they were an economical way to get a playlist of great music. *BST2* was an especially good one.

The title will be unfamiliar to those outside Canada, produced as it was by Canadian music channel MuchMusic, but here in the north it was a hit. It remains the [4th best selling album since 1995](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_albums_in_Canada). It eclipses Britney Spears' *...Baby One More Time*. It even surpasses Aqua's magnum opus *Aquarium*. *BST2* **sold**.

It introduced me to artists that remain among my favourites today: The Prodigy, Blur, Marilyn Manson, Radiohead. And let's not forget about Smash Mouth.

A sidebar on Smash Mouth. Apparently their bassist Paul De Lisle was born in my childhood hometown of Exeter, Ontario. What's incredible is that I only discovered this last year.[^2] To a city slicker this may seem unremarkable --- my urban friends were indifferent to this revelation --- but I need to emphasize how exciting even the most tenuous link to fame is in a small town.

Exeter's population is 4,600. It's remarkable perhaps only for its white squirrels.[^3] Residents of any repute are revered. Take *Simpsons* writer Tim Long, who attended the same high school as me. He wrote the episode "Skinner's Sense of Snow," based on a real blizzard in the 60s that trapped schoolchildren in the gymnasium for days. Every area kid who watched *The Simpsons*, which means every kid, knows the name Tim Long.

Now you'd be forgiven for being unfamiliar with the bassist of a lesser band, but we're talking about Smash Mouth. Even before they became a meme, before *Shrek* and that killer cover of *I'm a Believer*, they were superstars. But nobody mentioned the local connection. When I asked around, none of my childhood friends were aware of it either. They were equally astonished. I don't understand how this slipped past our radars.

But back to *BST2*. Many of the featured musicians still kick out the jams 23 years later. Damon Albarn of Blur went on to form Gorillaz and a dozen side projects. Marilyn Manson just released the fantastic *We Are Chaos*. Radiohead has done alright for themselves.

And what a tracklist. It starts with the snarling riff of *Breathe* by The Prodigy. It's scientifically impossible to drive to this song and stay under the speed limit. Next it's appropriately *Song 2* by Blur. Instantly catchy, objectively their most fun.[^4] Later comes *Beautiful People* by Marylin Manson. What a song. Those thumping drums, crunchy guitar, spooky orchestral chants, Manson's demonic vocals. It's exhilarating.

*Beautiful People* was long my favourite track. Today that honour goes to Radiohead's *Paranoid Android*. It's funny how you only appreciate some songs after repeated listens. For years *Paranoid Android* never caught my ear. I was idly playing *BST2* for the 1000th time when I heard it afresh, with its operatic movements, abrupt shifts in mood and tempo, Thom York's eerie falsetto over choral wailing. It's neither catchy nor easy listening, but it's a helluva tune.

*BST2* ignited my love of Radiohead and a host of other artists. I also bought *Big Shiny Tunes 3*, *4*, and *5*, but by the time *6* rolled around I had discovered Napster and was pirating everything from Cat Stevens to the *Aladdin* soundtrack. The series chugged along until *Big Shiny Tunes 14* in 2009, at which point I assume the iPod had strangled the CD business to death.[^5]

Today the options for discovering new music are endless, but I'll always be fond of that first fantastic playlist.

[^1]: I could afford it. I was making that [stone picking](/2020/09/27/stone-picking) money.

[^2]: I stumbled across De Lisle's birthplace during a Wikipedia bender that included researching the personal histories of 90s pop rock bands. Just your average Tuesday night.

[^3]: Growing up I thought Exeter went overboard bragging about their white squirrels. Why fuss about something so common? But no, apparently squirrels with white fur are [rare indeed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_squirrel#Albino_and_white_squirrels). Well, mostly. Exeter is one of four towns that claim the title "Home of the White Squirrel".

[^4]: You know what's even more fun than *Song 2*? [*Song 2*, but every "woohoo" is done by Mario](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66yH8RZSwUc).

[^5]: Though nobody told *NOW!* that CDs are out of vogue. The UK edition of the series is at [107 releases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Now_That%27s_What_I_Call_Music!_discography) and going strong.
