title: "New Music Playlist: Upcoming Shows"
---

I'm always on the hunt for new music. My usual gotos are radio stations on Apple Music --- Elton John's *[Rocket Hour](https://music.apple.com/us/curator/rocket-hour/993269779)* for its eclectic selection, *[The Alligator Hour](https://music.apple.com/us/curator/the-alligator-hour/993270307)* for a weirder mix --- and free stations like [Radio Paradise](https://radioparadise.com). Tim Bray's *[Song of the Day](https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/What/Song%20of%20the%20Day/)* blog posts were a fertile source of recommendations while they lasted.[^1]

I recently went to a Godspeed You! Black Emperor concert and wondered how I would stumble on them if they weren't already in my library.[^2] Countless other great bands play mere blocks away but never cross my radar. So my newest music-discovery-goto is compiling a playlist of bands visiting Vancouver in the near future and chucking it on at work.

The [Just Shows](http://justshows.com) RSS feed provides a solid directory of upcoming acts (though only for Canadian cities it seems). Once a week I look up the newly listed bands and enqueue their top hits. I ought to automate this process. I'm told Apple Music has an API. Could happen.

The signal-to-noise ratio thus far is lower than I'd hoped. On the plus side, when I hear a band I enjoy I can see them live immediately. *And* I can pretend that I'm in the know when it comes to the local music scene. That's worth something.

[^1]: A few favourites: *[Atomic](https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2018/03/10/SotD-Atomic)* by Blondie, *[Blue Skies](https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2018/03/03/SotD-Blue-Skies)* by Willie Nelson, *[Spinning Centers](https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2018/02/23/SotD-Spinning-Centers)* by Chelsea Wolfe. Real bangers.

[^2]: They're obscure. I first listened to GY!BE on a recommendation from a floormate in university, when procrastinating on calc homework in favour of droning half hour instrumentals seemed like a fine use of time.
