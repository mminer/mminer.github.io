title: "<em>The Secret History of Mac Gaming</em>"
---

Mac gaming seems like a niche topic. And it is. But I think those with even a casual interest in gaming history will enjoy this book, a compendium of the days when Mac-exclusive titles were a thing. It covers the influential blockbusters --- *Myst*, *SimCity*, *Marathon* (the forerunner of *Halo*) --- but also weird shareware hits like *Snood*.

I idled away many a night on our family Mac[^1] playing these games. My favourite was *Escape Velocity Nova*. It's a capable space trading sim, but what captivated me was its modding affordances. You can edit minor details like planet names, or you can put together a whole new universe and storyline. I never made it far with my efforts, but tinkering with *EVN* piqued my interest in programming which led to my career in software development (with that software occasionally of the game variety).

Through *EVN* I stumbled on the Ambrosia Software forums, my introduction to Internet culture. Ah, the days before Reddit, before social media, when phpBB was cutting edge and it was cool to have a username like XxFragNinja88xX.[^2] Does this make me sound old? It does, doesn't it?

One curious omission in *Secret History* is the genesis of the Unity game engine. The Ambrosia Software chapter mentions Over the Edge Entertainment's Mac-exclusive *GooBall*, but it neglects to call out that this flop was the genesis of Unity, which today dominates game development. It's not itself a game, sure, but few other applications have had such an impact on gaming, Mac or otherwise. Its cross-platform prowess is arguably part of the reason that producing games solely for the Mac now makes little sense.

I first encountered Unity in its [release announcement](https://www.insidemacgames.com/historical/news/story.php%3FArticleID=11424.html) on Inside Mac Games. This was around the time I was learning OpenGL and struggling to move crude shapes around the screen. Unity blew me away. Create a few cubes, hit play, and watch them fall and bounce on the ground --- astonishing. Hit pause, make adjustments, and see the game reflect your changes immediately --- *wizardry*.

But enough about Unity, let's talk *Bugdom*. I was thrilled to find out that the source code for it and other Pangea Software titles are [available on GitHub](https://github.com/jorio/Bugdom#more-pangea-stuff) and updated to run on modern hardware. I particularly enjoyed the soundtrack to *Bugdom*, which you can [listen to here](https://github.com/jorio/Bugdom/tree/master/Data/Audio). It's a bop.

Nowadays I seldom turn to my computer for my gaming fix --- my Switch and Playdate[^3] handle that duty --- but I enjoyed this trip down nostalgia lane.

[^2]: This was not my username. Whoever XxFragNinja88xX is, I bet they're a nice person.

[^3]: The Playdate, with its 1-bit black-and-white screen and thriving community of indie developers, reminds me of the heyday of Mac gaming. I'm having a ball with the quirky experiences people are building for this little yellow gizmo.
