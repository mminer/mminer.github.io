title: "Changing Unity's Boilerplate Script Code"
---

Quick tip: if you're not a fan of the boilerplate code that Unity spits out when you create a new script (for example, if you'd rather have an `OnGUI` function ready to go rather than `Start`), you can change it to whatever suits you best. In Mac OS X, right click on the Unity application, choose "Show Package Contents," and navigate to *Contents â†’ Resources*. You'll see three files named *NewBehaviourScript*. Open those up, modify them to your liking, and save.
