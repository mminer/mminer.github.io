title: "Netflix Gimmicks"
---

I watched *Kaleidoscope* on Netflix. Its conceit is that you watch the episodes in any order. Your experience differs from mine based on the sequence you choose.

Before that I saw *Bandersnatch*. Like a *Choose Your Own Adventure* book (or my favourite, *Give Yourself Goosebumps*), you guide the story via prompts that ask what the character should do next.

I found neither experience satisfying --- the episode order of *Kaleidoscope* feels inconsequential and the repeated scenes in *Bandersnatch* are a bore --- but I appreciate the experimentation. So I brainstormed more gimmicks for Netflix to try.

- Only the first million viewers get to watch an episode. After that it's gone forever (except for, you know, torrent sites).

- New episodes unlock only when enough people watch the previous one.

- Episodes are restricted to select time slots. Horror episodes air at 2 a.m.

- Storylines branch like *Bandersnatch*, but viewers collectively vote on the decisions.

- Episodes unlock with a token from somebody who already saw them. Finishing an episode grants you tokens to give to others.

- Episodes only play in select geographic locations. Want to see the thrilling finale? Book a plane ticket to Iqaluit.

- Episodes only play when a minimum number of people simultaneously try to watch them.

- Episodes unlock by viewing a different show. Extra points if the shows are unrelated. Interested in *The Jeffrey Dahmer Story*? Check out *Emily In Paris* first.

- Episodes can only be viewed a week apart, even if all the episodes are technically available. The cure for binge watching.

- Live television. Just imagine.
