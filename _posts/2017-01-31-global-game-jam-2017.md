title: "Global Game Jam 2017"

Here's a game I made for this year's Global Game Jam. For no good reason I christened it *Irisa*. Use your arrow keys to get your purple circle to the green pentagon while avoiding the spooky spiky things.

My goals were the same as [last year](/2016/12/21/hexahedral.html): keep the scope manageable, prioritize polish, make it fun. Sleep. Eat something green.

Tech-wise I stuck with vanilla JavaScript and CSS, with Vue.js thrown in to handle DOM rendering. `vw` and `vh` units keep the whole shebang responsive. Resize your browser and the game fits inside without breaking its square aspect ratio. I don't care that other teams produced networked VR experiences written in APL, that's Hogwarts Year 7 wizardry.

*Irisa* lacks instructions, which I figure is no biggie, but watching fellow developers take it for a spin suggests otherwise. Confusion is a poor first impression. Once players get the hang of it though they seem to dig the challenges. I threw together the levels haphazardly in the jam's final hours, so the difficulty ramps up erratically; levels in the middle require far more brainpower than later ones I meant to be gruelling. Let's say it's a metaphor for life.

Play *Irisa* above or open this sucker in [glorious full screen](http://matthewminer.com/irisa). If you're one of those nerds who likes looking at code, take a gander at the [source on GitHub](https://github.com/mminer/irisa). Or don't. You do you.
