title: "Wonderfully Weird VR Stock Photos"
---

That stock photos are ridiculous is nothing new --- look no further than [Women Laughing Alone With Salad](https://www.thehairpin.com/2011/01/women-laughing-alone-with-salad/) to convince yourself --- but those that depict people experiencing virtual reality can be especially absurd.

There's a plethora of models waving their hands around like Tom Cruise in *Minority Report*, naturally, and countless shots where the subject's mouth [hangs wide open](https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/20bqyw/mouths_close_them/) as VR blows their mind all the way to Halifax, but there are also scores of photos that are... well, *bonkers* describes them best.

Take, for instance, this man inexplicably hanging wallpaper while wearing a VR headset:

Or how about this image a coworker shared of a woman biking through serene countryside with a Gear VR HMD casually strapped to her face:

Operating a bicycle with completely obscured vision is preposterous, but I also marvel at the sheer difficulty of such a feat. Surprisingly, this isn't the only photo of somebody simultaneously riding a bike and experiencing VR.[^1]

Look at the sheer *joy* on this man's face. I may have just called the bicycle + VR combo preposterous, but this guy sells it. And it's not even the best one.

The bicycle in the living room. The enthusiastically supportive friends. The ecstatic woman with the bowl of popcorn. I love every detail of this stock photo. If this charming scene doesn't convince you that virtual reality is the most electrifying technological development since Microsoft Bob, nothing will.

[^1]: Though two-wheeled cycles dominate. Try as I might, I failed to find a stock photo of somebody riding a unicycle while wearing a VR headset. I smell opportunity.
