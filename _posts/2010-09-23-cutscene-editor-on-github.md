title: "Cutscene Editor on GitHub"

A quick update regarding the Unity Cutscene Editor.

The project's version control has moved from Subversion to Git, and is now hosted on GitHub rather than Google Code. You can check out the latest source from <http://github.com/mminer/silverscreen>. Once again, you're encouraged to report issues as you find them. It's an open source project, so everyone is welcome to contribute.

With the impending release of Unity 3, support will be dropped for Unity 2. Version 0.1 will always be available to download for those hesitant to upgrade to the latest and greatest. We have your back.
