title: "Summer of Code: Week Two"
---

A new requirement for the Summer of Code is to give weekly progress reports detailing what we've accomplished in the past week as well as what we intend to conjure up in the next one. I figure to give the blog some love, I'd post my progress reports here.

## Week 1

- Determined desired features
- Fleshed out media metaphors presented to user (shots, actors, audio and subtitles)
- Basic user interface setup
- Researched animations and animation events

## Week 2

- Classes: media, tracks, clips are objects
- Media can be added to timeline
- Playback: camera toggling, audio and subtitles
- More user interface setup
- Custom inspectors
- A scrubbable timeline
- Drag and drop media from project Hierarchy and Assets view
- Reviewed third-party code contribution

## Week 3

- Add ability to add actors
- Clip editing: drag clips to a new position on timeline
- Manage overlapping elements
- Make a zoomable timeline (it's now at a fixed zoom level)
- Razor tool
