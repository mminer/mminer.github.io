title: "Fungus Farmers"
---

Costa Rica is chockablock with [interesting critters](/2023/04/10/thirteen-photos-from-costa-rica), but the ones that impressed me most were leafcutter ants. Once you start looking you see them everywhere, dutifully hauling chunks of greenery to their nests, leaving perforated foliage behind.

I assumed leafcutter ants eat the leaves once they get home, but no, they *farm* them. Or rather, they use the leaves as fertilizer to grow fungus which feeds the colony, the population of which can be up to 8 million. That's a lot of fungus.

Here's video I took of these ants. Just look at these ambitious fellows.
