title: "GeekTool: Quick Access to Unity's Debug Logs"
---

[GeekTool](http://projects.tynsoe.org/en/geektool/) allows you to "display on your desktop different kind of informations." It can display images, the results of shell scripts, or in my case, the contents of Unity's web player debug logs. This is especially useful when the Unity editor crashes and I need to know why. At a glance I can see any errors that have occurred and all sorts of other funky information that gets sent to the Unity logs. When I'm not in development mode and don't want lines of cryptic text cluttering my desktop, I simply turn off the "Unity" group from GeekTool's menu bar dropdown.

Highly recommended.
