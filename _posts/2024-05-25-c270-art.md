title: "C270 Art"

My webcam died. It's a Logitech C270 HD, a cheap, no-nonsense, blue collar webcam. The working man's webcam. For years it worked flawlessly, until it didn't.

[This Reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/LogitechG/comments/u7q9tw/comment/izcg0e2/) suggests I remove the housing and pull on the camera sensor until the video feed returns to normal. This works, but only for 30 seconds at a time. I admitted defeat. Goodnight sweet prince.

On its march to the grave, the glitchy images it produces are striking. Check out these Easter pastels.

Lovely. How about this darker palette.

Its magnum opus is a piece I call *Matrix Sunrise*.
