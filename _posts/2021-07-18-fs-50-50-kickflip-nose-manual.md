title: "FS 50-50 + Kickflip + Nose Manual"
---

One of the games I played most in my youth was *Tony Hawk's Pro Skater*. When Activision released a remake of *[THPS 1 + 2](https://www.tonyhawkthegame.com)* I bought it immediately. Inject that sweet nostalgia straight into my eyeballs.

It's a dynamite revival. Gameplay is buttery smooth, the park creator massively improves the one I remember, and the soundtrack (all the songs from the originals minus three) is killer.

*THPS* was my introduction to punk rock. Growing up in rural Ontario with only a few radio stations and dial-up Internet, I seldom heard music outside your standard mainstream fare. Then I got a taste of Bad Religion and wanted more.

Likewise, *Superman* by Goldfinger was my first exposure to ska music. Ska has become a punchline in the years since but I don't care; throw horns on a punchy guitar riff and you have my attention. The most fun I had as a teenager was skanking in decrepit clubs to Reel Big Fish and Catch 22. I might not have known they exist if *THPS* hadn't clued me in.

This might sound odd for a game that blasts *Cyco Vision* and which results in a sickening fleshy crunch when you lose your balance,[^1] but playing *THPS* is meditative. Nothing aligns the chakras like landing the perfect combo. *[Alto's Adventure](http://altosadventure.com)* trades exclusively in this feeling. It's the ultimate wellness.

Playing again reawakens a phenomenon where I constantly evaluate the skateboardability of my surroundings. I judge parks not by their landscaping but on their rail placement. I get bummed when I see "no skateboarding" signs, despite not owning a skateboard and having difficulty even balancing on one. I also become a harsh critic of those who skateboard in real life. Landed a kickflip? Boring. Call me when you pull off a 900.

I sympathize with the modern gripe of repaying for games you've already bought,[^2] but when they're done as well as *THPS 1 + 2*, here's my wallet.

[^1]: The thousands of times I've virtually killed Tony Hawk is horrific. I'm sorry Tony.

[^2]: Nintendo is famous for this. I bought *The Wind Waker* for Game Cube, then again for Wii U, and I'll buy it yet again if they remaster it for the Switch. I have my eye on *Skyward Sword HD*. They've already locked in a future sale of *Breath of the Wild: 8K Edition*.
