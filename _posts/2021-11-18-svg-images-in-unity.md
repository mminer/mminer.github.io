title: "SVG Images in Unity"
---

Hey, you there, did you know that you can import SVG images into Unity? Neither did I until I stumbled across the [Vector Graphics](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.vectorgraphics@2.0/manual/index.html) package.

Add `com.unity.vectorgraphics` to your project using Unity's package manager then import SVGs to your heart's desire. The resulting asset can be a sprite for 2D games, a texture for 3D ones, or a specialized format for UGUI and UI Toolkit. It lacks support for text and filters and animations, but mostly it Just Worksâ„¢.

OK that's all. I'm just going to keep making these PSAs about lesser-known Unity packages until somebody tells me to stop.
