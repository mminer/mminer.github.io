title: "<em>Cinema Speculation</em>"

Lately I've been reading Quentin Tarantino's *Cinema Speculation*. If you want to feel like you're chatting with Tarantino about his favourite 70s movies (and I do), you'll enjoy this book.

Content aside, I dig his exuberant use of italics. "Don't overuse italics" is advice you hear from stuffy English professors, and they have a point, but here it makes the writing feel *alive*. Tarantino loves film and it shows. If [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ez4HFqAPcq4) doesn't mirror every meeting he's in I'd be shocked.
