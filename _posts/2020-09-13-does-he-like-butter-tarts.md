title: "Does He Like Butter Tarts?"
---

I recall a time in elementary school when a friend's dad drove us to science camp. Or something. The details are foggy, but I vividly remember the dad cranking *Steal My Sunshine* by Len. Absolutely blasting it. Maximum bass. The windows rattled. My bones vibrated.

And I thought: goddamn, this guy is *cool*.

In retrospect, a middle-aged white dude blaring *Steal My Sunshine* from his Dodge Caravan while driving preteen boys to science camp is nobody's definition of cool.[^1] It's a caricature of uncool. But your standards are different when you're eleven.

Never change, cool dad.

[^1]: To be clear, *Steal My Sunshine* is a dope song. It was one of the first I pirated on Napster. The very first was *Teenage Dirtbag*. Sorry Len and Wheatus. I hope my repeated listens in the streaming era generate enough royalties to atone for my Y2K transgressions.
